These are "hard skills" you should have if you want to be a successful engineer at any organization, large or small.  These are skills not only lead to individual success but empowers your team and creates a high performance culture.  Here are some examples:

* __Exceptional x-functional partner__ - Balancing the needs of the team, others and the company.  Sheperding ideas through, surfacing dissent yet being able to move projects along.
* __Excellent verbal and written communicator__ - Ability to convey ideas in succint and concise manner.  Distill complex ideas into simple to understand concepts.  Effective at communicating with folks of varying technical expertise.
* __Ownership / “tech-lead” mentality, product minded__ - Understand the "why" of doing features, tasks and items.  Thinking through how the changes will impact the customers.  Propensity to lead a project, regardless of the title you have.
* __Flexibility to do different things, hunger/humbleness to learn__ - Nothing is "beneath you" regardless of your seniority or experience.  Cursioity to learn more about things you don't know about but even things you consider yourself an expert in.  Desire to grow
