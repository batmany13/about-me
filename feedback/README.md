## 2021 Netflix 360s
Netflix has a feedback culture, and we do 360s every year (we skipped 2020 due to the pandemic).  We focused on "Top Strengths / Do More" and "Do better / Do Different".  I took all the feedback I received (20+) and compiled some themes

__More__
* Connecting the dots, bringing challenges, fresh ideas and concepts to PES teams
* Levity (used judiciously)
* Continue to absorb context from vast variety of partners and situations, and synthesize it for the team

__Differently__

* Driver fewer, but more thorough initiatives
* Slow down, farm for dissent, take more time to flesh out ideas/thoughts
* Build stronger rapport with team, try to address simmering issues more effectively
* Share more about what‚Äôs going on internally, get into the ‚Äúsausage making‚Äù with leadership team
* Leverage Partner connections for broader good
* Lower the ‚Äúthreshold‚Äù in which I give feedback to others


## Feedback from past managers

When I first joined Netflix in 2020, my boss had conducted "learning more about bruce" chats with former bosses of mine.  This wasn't a reference check, but a way to see how he could better support me.  This was such a good experience I wanted to include the results here

From PK

    Encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, balance with prioritization and honing what to focus on now vs later
    Coach on when to make the call on someone not working out in their role versus continuing to try and grow them

From DW

    He's most effective when he's a player coach. Bruce is best when he gets to roll up his leaves, get into the codebase, one of the best debuggers he has seen.
    Bruce just needs to be oriented and supported and then get out of his way. He's a doer, doesn't do well with a lot of bureaucracy. Focus him on execution.

From ST

    Bruce's super power is his contagious optimism. What many thought of as risks Bruce reframed as opportunities.
    Growth area is to be open with your critiques.
