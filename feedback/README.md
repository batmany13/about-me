# Feedback
These are feedback reflections I've had over the years, and some high-level themes on both strengths and opportunities

## 2025 Netflix 360s Theme

__Strengths__    

* Leading with passion, courage, and lightness    
* Building new pathways   
* (long-running feedback) Connecting the Dots     

__Opportunities__

* (long-running feedback) Slowing down    
* Mind the weight of my words or actions    
* Better, rounded out understanding and communication    

### Strength is my weakness exercise

Separately outside of 360s, I did a your strengths are your weaknesses exercise, which is to highlight how strengths can turn into weaknesses, and in some cases when combined together can cause a lot of issues.  For instance, passion, and lightness can cause understimating the power of words, connecting the dots may not yield deeper understanding of a situation.  Being able to see how my strengths show up as weaknesses can give a more nuanced appreciation of my skills and opportunities.

## 2024 Netflix 360s Theme


__Where I shine__
* Passion, energy, and enthusiasm
* Relationships and partnerships throughout Netflix
* Bias to action, rolling up my sleeves and getting into the details
* Curiosity and asking pointed questions, surfacing an underlying issue or concern 

__Failure modes__    
Oftentimes, strengths can create blind spots or weaknesses that need calibrating to be more effective

* (long-running feedback) Overenthusiasm - hard to tell what is a priority, and pulling the team into too many directions
* (long-running feedback) Moving too fast - need to bring people along and provide more space to absorb changes and collect feedback
* Lack of true alignment - It is not enough to build the bridge to partners or use superpowers of connectivity, need to align our work together and get buy-in
* Mixed Signals - friendly enthusiasm may not lead to appropriate candor for certain situations

## 2023 Netflix 360s Themes

🎉  partnerships, vision, context sharing, strong memo game    
🚧  more concise verbal comms, think about how to step back more (especially around API)    
🆘 Reign in my ideas, push on how it fits to my current priorities    

## 2022 Netflix 360s

__More__
* Connect the dots
* Partnerships, relationships
* API Champion, empathetic leader

__Differently__
* Less but better (less ideas, and push more)
* Share context better
* Share leadership thinking better
* Summarize, improve comms
* Delegate more


## 2021 Netflix 360s
Netflix has a feedback culture, and we do 360s every year (we skipped 2020 due to the pandemic).  We focused on "Top Strengths / Do More" and "Do better / Do Different".  I took all the feedback I received (20+) and compiled some themes

__More__
* Connecting the dots, bringing challenges, fresh ideas and concepts to PES teams
* Levity (used judiciously)
* Continue to absorb context from vast variety of partners and situations, and synthesize it for the team

__Differently__

* Driver fewer, but more thorough initiatives
* Slow down, farm for dissent, take more time to flesh out ideas/thoughts
* Build stronger rapport with team, try to address simmering issues more effectively
* Share more about what’s going on internally, get into the “sausage making” with leadership team
* Leverage Partner connections for broader good
* Lower the “threshold” in which I give feedback to others


## Feedback from past managers

When I first joined Netflix in 2020, my boss had conducted "learning more about bruce" chats with former bosses of mine.  This wasn't a reference check, but a way to see how he could better support me.  This was such a good experience I wanted to include the results here

From PK

    Encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, balance with prioritization and honing what to focus on now vs later
    Coach on when to make the call on someone not working out in their role versus continuing to try and grow them

From DW

    He's most effective when he's a player coach. Bruce is best when he gets to roll up his leaves, get into the codebase, one of the best debuggers he has seen.
    Bruce just needs to be oriented and supported and then get out of his way. He's a doer, doesn't do well with a lot of bureaucracy. Focus him on execution.

From ST

    Bruce's super power is his contagious optimism. What many thought of as risks Bruce reframed as opportunities.
    Growth area is to be open with your critiques.
