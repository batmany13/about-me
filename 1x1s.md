# 1x1s

1x1s is the most important tool for a people leader.  There are several kinds I employ to build strong, lasting relationships and help grow my teammates (and myself).

## Getting to know you

Whenever I take on a new team or hire a new employee, I use this.  I consider this a very special 1x1 because its when you make your first impression as a manager and set the tone for the relationship moving forward.  I always come from a place of caring of the whole self, so this is more about getting to know the person and what makes them tick.

### Team/Company Related
* What's your origin story?  How did you get into technology?
  * What's your favorite thing about it?
  * What do you not like?
* Deep dive in your role and responsibilities and:
  * What do you enjoy
  * What don't you like?
* If you think the team could change one thing immediately, what would it be?
* What is a longer term change you'd like to see? (this could be technical, org structure, process wise etc)

### Feedback and Celebrating
* How do you like to receive feedback? - For instance: immediately in person, or email first and then in person or some other way
* What's your favorite way to celebrate as a team? (i.e. dinner with team, wine tasting, bowling, bocce etc)
* How do you like to be [recognized](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-the-5-languages-of-appreciation-in-the-workplace/) as an individual?
  * Words of Affirmation
  * Quality Time
  * Acts of Service
  * Tangible Gifts
* When do you like to do 1x1s?  Morning, afternoon, any particular days you prefer, Monday vs Friday?
* How do you like your 1x1s to be ran?  Is there a particular format you had in the past you really liked?

### Personal
* What do you enjoy doing outside of work?
* What's your favorite food, any particular restaurants you like that serves it?
* What's your favorite dessert?

## Recurring

These are usually weekly, same time, same day, 45-60 mins and typically for direct reports.  Ideally the individual brings the agenda so they can cover topics relevant to them.  However, I do have a sample agenda I use that typically helps guide the conversation and focus in on key things.  The 1x1 time should be considered "sacred" and not to be moved or changed unless either party is on vacation.

### Sample Agenda

* Check in
  * Did you do anything fun last week?
  * what did you work on last week that made you happy?
  * What drained your energy or annoyed you?
* Goals Update (for example OKR check-ins)
  * How is the work driving KRs?
  * Are there other things you think we should work on?
* Feedback
  * What are things I am doing that is helping you do your job?
  * What are things I am doing that is hindering you?
* Development Plan Progress
  * What did you work on last week that helped with your development plan?
  
## Skip Levels

This applies to managers who manage managers and its important to do skip levels every so often (every quarter or two).  It helps you get closer to the action and understand whats working or not working with the specific teams.  It also lets you build rapport with individual contributors so it doesn't seem like you're unapproachable.  This is even more important if you're in upper management and have multiple layers of reports.  It may be hard to find the time but I think is an important investment.

## Development Plan / Career Growth Planning

Typically this is done every 6 months.  I like to have a separate meeting or dedicate an entire 1x1 for this.  This is driven by the individual and its their plan, not yours.  That being said, I like to encourage growth in areas that may be slightly uncomfortable.  I've used the below sample format to help encourage people to think openly about their plan.

* What are you good at that you want to keep on getting good at? 
* What are you interested in learning that you don't know already?
* What makes you uncomfortable or worried about learning? - examples: public speaking, networking, giving critical feedback
* Pick 2-3 things from the above list that you want to get good at.
  * Set "key results" for those goals and figure out what you will do specifically to help acheive those.  So take an example of "I want to get better at giving critical feedback".  How will you improve this?  Are there specific classes you will take?  Who would you like to try it on first?  How is your critical feedback responses been?

### GROW Framework

Using frameworks can be helpful to have a good career conversation.  The ["GROW"](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_89.htm) framework focuses on these topics:

* Goals - what are you career goals over the next 3-5 years? 
* Reality - whats your current reality, what skills are you missing to meet that goal?
* Options - what are the options you have, what can you work on
* Will / Way Forward - what are your next steps to make this happen?

## Stay Interviews / Career Check-ins

Think of these as an exit interview before someone actually leaves your team or the company.  The primary goal of this exercise is to create an environment of trust and safety to talk openly and honestly about your report's career aspirations, what keeps them here and what would make them leave the team or the company altogether.
